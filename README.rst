Who's Afraid of the Big Bad ceval Loop?
=======================================

This repository contains the resources used to give the PyCascades/PyTennessee talk.
The "handout.pdf" is probably the most useful resource:
it has the slides
(but only in fully-revealed form)
and the "speaker notes".
While it is not as readable as an article intended to be consumed by reading,
it is a reasonable reference post-talk
to the discussion that took place.

The "talk.pdf" contains the slides.
It is useful mostly as a reference slide-deck while watching the video:
for example,
you can increase the font on it,
or use a local text reader,
to make watching the talk video a more accessible experience.

It also has the LaTeX files,
and build tooling,
to enable modification and rebuild.
