Mishna: Blessing on fruits:
Tree -- Pri ha'etz, wine -- pri hagafen, 
Bushes -- pri ha'adama, bread, hamotzi
on vegetables -- adama,

R Yehuda: d'shaim

Gm: R. Adkiva: bless before eating
Lev 19.24

R. Yonatan: Only say songs on the wine
Judges 9.13

So the halakha is from gz'era shava.

Also a-fortriori, blessing when hungry.

OK but what about the other stuff?

It can't just be equivalence

But we also have grain

Between those two, we have blessing before evertything.

But they are both offered on an altar.

But they are also both shivat haminim.

Sages: no benefit without a blessing.

How to fix? Learn the blessing.

Psalms 24.1 before a blessing,
Psalms 115.16 after

R. Shimon ben Yohai: Take care of the torah, and the growings will
take care of themselves.
Isaiah 61.5

Abaye: You gotta work

Rava: during the right time, go work the fields

R. Yehuda b' Rabi El'ai: We are not as holy.

That's why people do tax evasion

What's special about pri hagefen? It's not just the processing,
we say pri ha'etz on olive oil.

Rav and Shmuel: mazonot is only for grain
